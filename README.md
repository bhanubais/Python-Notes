# Python Notes

I read many books and completed many courses belongs to Python Programming language. This Project is summary of all resources I have got. In this Project, I tried to maintain all Python programming perspective at single place.

## Whom these Notes for?

These notes for everyone who want to familiar Python Environment quickly.

## Instruction to use this Notes

 1. Install Jupyter Notebook using following command after installing latest Python Code as administrator.
    `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
    `python -m pip install jupyter`
 2. Pull this repository using Git on your system and change directory into this folder and run following command to run Jupyter.
    `cd where/you/download`
