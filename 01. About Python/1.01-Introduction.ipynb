    " - **Space**: The International Space Station's Robonaut 2 robot uses Python for its central command system. Python is planned for use in a European missian to March in 2020 to collect soil samples\n",
    " - **CERN Large Hadron Collider**: Python helps understand the data analysis from some atom smashing experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.\n",
    " - **Astronomy**: The Keekat Radio telescope array (the largest radio telescope in the Southern Hemisphere) uses Python for its control and moitoring systems.\n",
    " - **Movie Studio**: Automate movie production processes. Side Effectes Software's computer-generated imagery program Houdini uses Python for its programming interface and to sdcript the engine.\n",
    " - **Games**: Activision uses Python for building games, testing and analyzing stuff. They even use Python to find people cheating by boosting each other.\n",
    " - **Music**: Spotify music streaming service uses Python to send you music.\n",
    " - **Video**: Netflix uses Python to make sure movies play (stream) whitout stopping. Python is used a lot for Youtube.\n",
    " - **Internet Search**: Google used Python all over in its early development phase.\n",
    " - **Medicine**: Nodality company uses Python to handle information that they use to search for a cure to cancer.\n",
